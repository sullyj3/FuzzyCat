Experimenting in fuzzy categorisation of word lists.

I came up with an idea. I want my web browser to categorise my tabs automatically by keywords. That way I'll be able to focus on one thing at a time, without having to think about organizing things, or being distracted. I realised that in order to do that, in the abstract, i'd have to come up with some way of categorizing lists of words by keywords. This repo is basic experimentation on that front.
